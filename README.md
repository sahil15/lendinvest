# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### What could have been done

1) We can use state management like redux to maintain the state instead of passing props and while doing that we can show the updated inforamation on first page and update tha available loans information as well.
2) Test the component further with mocking response and further tests.
3) We can use webpack to compile code and create a build folder to minimize the structure.
